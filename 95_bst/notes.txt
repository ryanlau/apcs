DISCO
0. Drawing the BST on paper given the nodes helped in figuring out how to implement the insert function.
1. Given the nodes and the value of the root node, there is can only be one unique BST???

QCC
0. Is there a way to print out what the tree would look like as if we drew it on paper?
1. Why is the constructor needed?


With L = level, d = depth, h = heightâ€¦

1. a perfect binary tree has 2^(h+1) - 1 nodes
2. at each level, a perfect binary tree has 2^h nodes
3. height of a complete binary tree w/ n nodes is the floor of log(2, n)
