DISCOS
1. ArrayList<Integer> al = new ArrayList<Integer>() seems to be the same as ArrayList<Integer> al = new ArrayList<>()

QCC
1. Should .remove() still point to a node if we are removing the last node?
2. When should we throw a IllegalStateException if _okToRemove is false and .remove() is called?
3. What is a default method?
