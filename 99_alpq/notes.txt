DISCO
0. Similar to OrderedArrayList with the difference being that you do not sort the elements of the ArrayList as you add them in.
1. This results in the following runtimes:
    isEmpty()   -> O(1)
    add(int x)  -> O(1)
    peekMin()   -> O(n)
    removeMin() -> O(n)

QCC
0. When would we use an ArrayPriorityQueue instead of OrderedArrayList?
