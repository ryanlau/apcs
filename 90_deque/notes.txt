DISCO
0. We decided that it would be best to encapsulate a LinkedList since we believe it would allow for constant time adding and removing from the front and the back.

1. The direction of the linkages probably don't matter since we are dealing with doubly linked nodes this time.

2. Make sure to include an 'identifier' for the interface abstract method parameters. Not just the variable type is needed (such as in a UML diagram) but also a variable name.

QCC
0. We were able to easily implement all of our QQKachoo methods with the methods of LinkedList.
