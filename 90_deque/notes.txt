DISCO
0. We decided that it would be best to encapsulate a LinkedList since we believe it would allow for constant time adding and removing from the front and the back.

1. The direction of the linkages probably don't matter since we are dealing with doubly linked nodes this time.

2. Make sure to include an 'identifier' for the interface abstract method parameters. Not just the variable type is needed (such as in a UML diagram) but also a variable name.

3. The difference between get and peek is that get throws a NPE if the Deque is empty but peek will just return null.

QCC
0. We were able to easily implement all of our QQKachoo methods with the methods of LinkedList.

1. Why is peek() and peekFirst() provided by Java's deque if they do the same job?
