0. Swap node you want to delete with the furthest right node
1. Delete that node you just swapped (it is now a leaf)
2. Heapify (make sure heap is heaped):
    0. if heap is heap (heap property is true), do nothing
    1. else if the replacement node's value is less than or equal to its parent's node value, swap the two, repeat step 2
    2. else, swap the replacement node with the smallest child, and repeat step 2
