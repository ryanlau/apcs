ACTIVITY 1

1a. public static double sentimentVal(String)

1b. Yes, it requires a String parameter. If you pass a different type of parameter, the compiler will return a error saying that the different type cannot be converted to a String:

ReviewDriver.java:4: error: incompatible types: int cannot be converted to String

1c. This method returns a double.

2.

Method Call           | Return Value
=====================================
sentimentVal("hello") | 0.75
sentimentVal("bob")   | -0.16
sentimentVal("ryan")  | 0.04

3a. This will compile because sentimentVal was called with a single String parameter and the return type is a double which matches the signature of sentimentVal.

3b. This will not compile because sentimentVal was called with a double parameter and the return type is a String which does not match the signature of sentimentVal.

3c. This will not compile because sentimentVal was called with a two String parameters which does not match the signature of sentimentVal.
