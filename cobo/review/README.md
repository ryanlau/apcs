### Team Gnocchi -- Hugo Jenkins (Boary), Ryan Lau (Jon), and Brian Kang (Vivian)

In lab06, we learned about reading the content of a file so that we could process the data later in our code.

We also learned about Java's hashmap which lets us assign a value to a key.

Hashmaps can be initialized like this:

```java
HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts = new HashMap<String, Integer>();
```

You can set the value of a key with HASHMAP_INSTANCE.put(KEY, VALUE).

And get the value of a key with HASHMAP_INSTANCE.get(KEY).

Getting the value of a key that does not exist in the hashmap will return null.
